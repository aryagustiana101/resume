## Overview

This is my Resume / CV craft and built with Tex / LaTeX. I might consider using Microsoft Word or Google Docs in the future time because of the ATS issue.

## Running The Project

To run the project you need to install [`Tex Live`](https://www.tug.org/texlive/) and [`LaTeX Workshop`](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=James-Yu.latex-workshop) extension for Visual Studio Code.

In addition, if you would like to run a project online without installing anything, you can try using an online LaTeX editor such as [`Overleaf`](https://www.overleaf.com/).
